# The Impact of Multidimensional Opinions and Recommendation Algorithms on Social Network Polarization

### Author: Isabela Tellechea Coluccio

This repository was created for the completion of my Master's Degree in Computer Science at Universidad de Chile. My thesis (publicly available soon) details the investigation and is a recommended read before exploring the code.

Details of the files:

- `MultidimensionalOpinions.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook that contains the full code. It was made in Google Colab, so there might be differences when installing the dependencies in other systems. A Gurobi license is necessary to run the code (particularly, the third experiment). Luckily, this license can be obtained for free for research and educational purposes.

- `Figures` (Folder): Contains the results from the investigation as plots in PDF format, separated by experiment. They are not the same as the results shown in the Jupyter Notebook, those are from a different execution.
